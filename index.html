  <h2> Snake Game </h2>
    <p> I watched videos on YouTube to code this game. It took about an hour to make and I learned how to add sound effects.</p>

   <h3> This is the Game Over screen when you die. [which I designed myself :)]</h3>
  <h2> Taking Good Pictures </h2>
  <p>  I used a video that helped me improve my mobile photography skills. I learned a new way to angle my camera for the best photo.</p>

       <h3> I took this picture outside in the campus of my school. I liked the leaves in the background :) </h3>
    <h2> Creating a Poster on Canva</h2>
   <p>In class we learned about ace alignment, color combos, tints and shades, and using different fonts. I applied all of those to my poster and this is what I came up with.</p>
